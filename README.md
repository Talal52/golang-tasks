-> filereading: 
              This is a Go program that reads the contents of a file named "text.txt" using the os.ReadFile() function, which returns the file's contents as a byte slice. The if err != nil statement checks if an error occurred during the file reading process, and if so, prints the error message to the console using fmt.Println(). Otherwise, the program converts the byte slice to a string using string(talal) and prints it to the console using fmt.Println().

As for the version of Go that supports this code, the os.ReadFile() function was introduced in Go version 1.16, which was released in February 2021. So, any version of Go that is 1.16 or later should support this code.
